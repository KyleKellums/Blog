			<h2>New Things to Learn</h2>
			<p>My studies had been focused on HTML, CSS and javaScript as I prepared for the 6-month bootcamp. I hadn't prepared for working in the terminal, nor had I been familiar with GitHub. From the first day I felt like I was behind in a race. This week I will be researching and practicing alot in order to grasp the fundamentals of the terminal and GitHub. Instructors and students are both ready to help when I get stuck. I can tell that the comprehension comes as I practice. I grow every time I create a new file in the terminal and every time I push a new file to GitHub. There are many new things to learn. I will trust the process and get better every day.</p>

			<h2>Cohort-18 Demo Day</h2>
			<p>Cohort 18 presented their capstone projects. It was impressive to see how much knowledge the students possessed after 12 weeks of being here. One one hand it was a little daunting to think of all that I did not know.  On the other hand it was encouraging to hear other students say they didn't even know what a terminal was when they started. There was even a student who had never owned a computer before he applied to the program. The students also gave great advice to cohort 19. I consistently heard phrases like, "Don't be afraid to ask for help," "Learn from your teammates", and much more. It is amazing to think that I will be where they are in such a short amount of time.</p>

			<h2>Benchmark Myself</h2>
			<p>I have heard instructors say several times this past week to benchmark myself. This means that I should not compare myself to others, but measure my own progress. There a many students in our cohort that seem much farther down the road than I am. Although I wish I were amongst the most knowledgable group, I cannot be discouraged by the fact that I am still such a novice. I must honestly assess where I am, what I need to learn and shore up, and take account of my growth every week.</p>

			<h2>Learn From Others</h2>
			<p>There will always be people around in this field that know way more than I do. I can't get intimidated or discouraged by this. Instead, I should always ask questions from those who know more than me. Glean from them even when they discuss topics that are over my head. I view it like I would as a musician. I'd always want to surround myself with people that were better than me. It's more difficult to do this when you are a novice. As competency grows it will be increasingly more invigorating to be surrounded by those who are ahead.</p>

			<h2>Keep Studying the Foundations</h2>
			<p>One thing that is clear as I come to the end of the week. I must build a strong foundation. I must continue to cover core concepts in HTML, CSS, javaScript, the terminal and with GitHub. This will come by studying concepts I have not yet studied, reviewing concepts that seem fuzzy, and practicing everything I learned this past week. Those things include creating branches, pushing and pulling files with GitHub, and more. I will also go through more exercises with the Mark Myers books. In addition, I will continue to work on the static web exercises, which challenge how well I really know HTML, CSS, and javaScript.</p>
